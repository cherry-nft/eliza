# Pattern Effectiveness Tracking - Current Implementation Status

## Overview

This document outlines the current implementation status of pattern effectiveness tracking in the Artcade plugin, focusing on measuring Claude's usage of patterns and their impact on HTML output quality.

## Why is this important?

- Okay, thousands of users currently come to my site daily.
- They prompt something like "make me a minigame of a car racing game"
- In production, we process that user_prompt through our system prompt, which I've added to @artcade-prompt.md .
- As you can see that prompt is processed by Claude who generates a self-contained HTML file as well as a title description and SVG thumbnail for the users prompt.
- About 70% of the time, the generated HTML file comes back working and properly sized in the canvas with a good layout but just is boring. Either the interaction is limited or it's not visual enough or could have some mechanical improvements like score collision detection sliders some other interactivity or gamification.
- About 30% of the time, the generated HTML file comes back either completely broken, improperly sized for the canvas, or just has some critical broken functionality (for example: a small mini game with no play again button doesn't which doesn't let the user play the game again is a critical broken functionality even if the game itself works well).
- That's why I set up this entire embedding infrastructure with ElizaDB.
- I wanted to deposit 30+ HTML files that I know are awesome accomplish the goals that we want to accomplish and Are always functional and excellent. They are strong reflections of the types of HTML generated files that our users would want to see back.
- I did that and now our current infrastructure is processing all of those html files as embeddings as far as I can tell at least.
- My goal is to be able to give the user prompt, have it get processed through our currently existing system prompt, then see the resulting output in the "Pattern Preview" area.
- But critically I want to be sure that Claude is referencing the embeddings and learning from them in some way when it gives the output back.
- In other words, given the quality of our embeddings I want to increase the quality html generation file rate from 70% to 99%.
- I want to be able to test HTML generations and evolve them with all of the code snippets and embeddings that we put into the database.
- If good patterns are generated by Claude with our system prompt, I also want to add them to the library of good patterns.

## Current Architecture

```typescript
// packages/plugin-artcade/src/types/effectiveness.ts
export interface PatternEffectivenessMetrics {
    pattern_id: string;
    prompt_keywords: string[];
    embedding_similarity: number;
    claude_usage: {
        direct_reuse: boolean;
        structural_similarity: number;
        feature_adoption: string[];
        timestamp: Date;
    };
    quality_scores: {
        visual: number;
        interactive: number;
        functional: number;
        performance: number;
    };
    usage_stats: {
        total_uses: number;
        successful_uses: number;
        average_similarity: number;
        last_used: Date;
    };
}
```
