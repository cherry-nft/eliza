# Artcade Pattern Enhancement System

## Goal

To create a system that enhances Claude's HTML generation by leveraging our embedded pattern library. The system will:

1. Accept a user prompt and generate initial HTML using Claude
2. Use semantic search to find relevant patterns from our vector database
3. Provide these patterns as context to Claude for HTML enhancement
4. Return improved HTML that incorporates learned patterns while maintaining the user's original intent

This should use Claude's in-context learning capabilities with our vector-embedded patterns as reference material. The enhancement comes from Claude's ability to understand and adapt patterns from our curated library based on semantic similarity.

## Key Concepts

- Vector Embeddings: Used for semantic similarity search
- Pattern Matching: Finding relevant examples from our library
- Context Enhancement: Providing matched patterns to Claude
- Semantic Room IDs: Text-based identifiers for pattern categorization
- In-Context Learning: Claude's ability to learn from provided examples

## Current Flow

1. Frontend (React)

    - User enters prompt in PromptInput component
    - "Generate Pattern" button triggers handlePromptSubmit
    - App.tsx manages state and coordinates pattern generation

2. Client Service Layer

    - ClientPatternService.generatePattern sends POST to /generate
    - Handles response validation and error management
    - Coordinates pattern search and comparison

3. Backend Generation
    - /generate endpoint (to be implemented)
    - Claude interaction for initial HTML generation
    - Pattern matching using vector similarity
    - Enhanced output generation

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Pattern Matching System

- Convert user prompt to embedding vector
- Search vector database for similar patterns
- Use semantic room_ids for additional context
- Rank patterns by relevance and effectiveness

### 2. Claude Integration

- Initial prompt processing
- Pattern injection into context
- HTML generation with pattern awareness
- Quality validation and enhancement

### 3. Enhancement Pipeline

a. Input Processing

- Analyze user prompt for key requirements
- Extract semantic meaning and intent
- Identify relevant pattern categories

b. Pattern Selection

- Query vector database
- Filter by semantic similarity
- Sort by effectiveness score
- Select top N most relevant patterns

c. Context Construction

- Format selected patterns for Claude
- Include semantic tags and metadata
- Structure examples for optimal learning
- Maintain original prompt intent

d. Output Generation

- Generate enhanced HTML
- Validate against requirements
- Apply quality metrics
- Return final result

### 4. Quality Assurance

- Validate HTML structure
- Check semantic alignment with prompt
- Verify pattern integration
- Measure effectiveness metrics

### 5. Feedback Loop

- Track pattern usage
- Update effectiveness scores
- Monitor enhancement success
- Refine pattern selection
